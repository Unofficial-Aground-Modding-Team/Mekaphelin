# Mekaphelin
Will be split into two different versions/editions.

Mekaphelin - CybCat Edition: (Work on first)
  - Focused around just one planet, the green planet in the system.
  - The system will have no desert planet in this version. No UEFD or UEFD-related stuff.
  - Contains all the lore related to cybcats, their questline, NPCs, tech, etc.

Mekaphelin - UEFD Edition: (Work on simultaneously, but ultimately later)
  - Focused around the gas giant and the desert planet, green planet is barren.
  - The system will be more UEFD-focused, with the inclusion of the Meks (super-tech aliens).
  - Contains all UEFD lore, questline, Meks lore, questline, and all their different techs.
  - Also, BIG spaceships. Nuff' said.

These two editions will be combined into one main mod at the very end.

Mekaphelin: Consolidated
  - Add some finishing touches that bring everything together nicely;
     * UEFD Security Drone-Net over the Cybcat world, to make their questline more like Unnature in a way.
     * Add secret alternate ending, achieved by finishing the Meks questline.
