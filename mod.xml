		<!-- TODO :
		1st [Alpha] Release (Proof-of-concept):
		* Set up the Mekaphelin system.
		- Green star, 1st planet is green/skyblue colored terrestrial planet, 2nd planet is lavender gas giant, with 2 moons, the sand-colored desert moon and the grey dead moon.

		* Create the UEFD Outpost base on the desert moon of the purple gas giant, 1st in orbit from the star.
		- The outpost is a mishmash of bunker buildings and tech. (Airom, you might wanna mash together some bunker buildings together and gimme some concepts for that.)

		* Add the dead moon around the gas giant as well, filled with basic resources.
		- Basic as in iron, quartz, gold, diamond, exo matter. Any other basic mining resources as needed.

		(* Add mechs, exosuits, potentially the corvette.
		* Drone Mechs are part of this update.)
		Waiting on Airom for the last two parts.
		On the topic of resources,
		Desert moon can have oil, titanium, uranium, gold and chromium, and maybe a mountain range with trees for wood and coal mines.

		Vast tracts of desert land can be used for farming as well, after its terraformed.
